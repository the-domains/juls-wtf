Recently I went to a typical german festival to meet up with my dad, mum and granny. I was glad seeing them cause it has been a few weeks. I´m living in a city about 4 hours away from my hometown and so I don´t see them as much as I used to see and I was really happy.

I came straight from work to that festival in my city and they´ve been there already for several hours. I came to see them, drink some beer and have a good time. My family is really loud and most of the time all over the place but my mum. She is a calm lady who doesn´t talk a lot and her vioce is most of the time underheard cause of my loud and life loving dad. After a hearty welcome my mum gave me a gift that really surprised me. It was a book, nicely wrapped in kids paper. Before I could even open my gift she said in really chosen words, which were supposed to calm me. I know her voice when she is uncertain about something she thinks might upset me. So she said: „It´s a book written in english and I thought you might like it because it´s in english and...it might help you." So I unwrapped my gift.

I can´t really express my feelings when I saw the books titel: „Quaterlife Crisis". Whaaaat? Mum? Why? Do you think I am in the middle of a quaterlife crisis? I was kind of shocked. I tried not to be rude. I was in between laughing strangely and telling her things like next time she will get a midlife crisis book and things like that. Then I put the book away and had great family time and forgot about the book for the rest of the day.

When I arrived home and unpacked my purse I saw it. This book. I questioned myself. Do I appear to others like I am in a crisis? Don´t they think I am happy? I told some colleagues and friends about it and they all just laughed and said: „well you might start thinking about it". And so I did. I started thinking about it and decided to read the book and make my own conclusions.

Now I am reading the book and will tell you more about it soon...
