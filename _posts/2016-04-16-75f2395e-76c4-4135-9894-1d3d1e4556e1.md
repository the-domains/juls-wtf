... for some stories about a girl who´s not always like others.

A long time ago, I think it was 8 years ago, someone told me for the first time I should write a book about all the crazy things happening to me. At least crazy for other people. Most of the time not crazy for me. I always thought "well, it was funny that happened to me". But time after time and years and situations passing by I started to wonder if it´s just pure random or if it´s really me. Up to this very day I don´t know. Maybe you could tell...

Here I want to share some stories of my life with you. Maybe even to inspire you or help you to deal or even get over something you are dealing with. If you like it come back and if you don´t, well.... don´t.
