... for some stories about a girl who´s not always like others.

A long time ago, I think it was 8 years ago, someone told me for the first time I should write a book about all the crazy things happening to me. At least crazy for other people. Most of the time not crazy for me. I always thought "well, it was funny that happened to me".
